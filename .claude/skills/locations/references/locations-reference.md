# Locations Reference

Complete documentation for `tabs/locations.json`.

## Schema

```typescript
interface Location {
  name: string                      // ✅ Display name, must match object key
  basicInfo: string                 // ✅ Description of the location
  x: number                         // ✅ X coordinate on world map
  y: number                         // ✅ Y coordinate on world map
  radius: number                    // ✅ Size of location (affects travel time)
  region: string                    // ✅ Key from regions.json
  complexityType: ComplexityType    // ✅ 'simple' | 'complex' | 'wilderness'
  detailType: 'basic' | 'detailed'  // ✅ Detail level - 'basic' triggers AI generation
  areas?: Record<string, Area>      // ✅ Areas within location (for complex types)
  factions?: string[]               // ✅ Keys from factions.json
  hiddenInfo?: string               // ✅ Secret information revealed through exploration
  visualTags?: string[]             // ✅ Visual metadata tags for the location
  imageUrl?: string                 // ✅ URL for the location's image
  embeddingId?: string              // ✅ Reference to embeddings record
  known?: boolean                   // ✅ Defaults to true; set false to hide at game start
  npcLevelRange?: { min: number, max: number }  // ✅ Optional level band for NPCs generated here. NPCs with no explicit level are rolled near party level, then clamped into this band. Takes priority over the region's band. NPCs with an explicit level ignore it
  visited?: boolean                 // ❌ Always false at creation
  lastVisitedTick?: number          // ❌ Always 0 at creation
  visitedAreas?: string[]           // ❌ Always [] at creation
  questOriginArcId?: string         // ✅ Auto-generated for quest-spawned locations. Links to the arc that spawned this location; provides arc context to AI detail generation
  questOriginQuestId?: string       // ✅ Auto-generated for quest-spawned locations. Links to the quest that spawned this location; provides quest design brief to AI detail generation
}

type ComplexityType = 'simple' | 'complex' | 'wilderness'
```

### Legend

- ✅ **Predefine-able**: Can be set in config, preserved via spread
- ❌ **Always overwritten**: Set by initialization regardless of what exists in config

## Area Schema

```typescript
interface Area {
  description: string   // Brief description of the area
  paths: string[]       // Connected area names (must be bidirectional)
  imageUrl?: string     //  URL for the area's image
  visualTags?: string[] //  Engine-written cache of the tags used for the area's image prompt
}
```

Areas define internal structure for complex locations. The `paths` array creates a graph of connected spaces that controls movement within the location.

**Path rules:**
- Bidirectional recommended: If A lists B in paths, B should list A
- Validation auto-fixes missing reverse paths
- Every area must have at least one path to be reachable
- Paths only work within a location, not between locations

## Complexity Types

| Type | Description | Areas Required |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `simple` | Single area, quick to traverse | No |
| `complex` | Multiple areas, detailed exploration | Yes (if detailed) |
| `wilderness` | Open area, coordinate-based movement | Optional |

When the party ends a scene in untracked space and no permanent settlement is established, the engine falls back to a synthetic location named `Wilderness` (with area `Wilderness`). This name is case-insensitive on parse — `wilderness`, `Wilderness`, and `WILDERNESS` from the AI all canonicalize to `Wilderness`.

## Detail Types

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `basic` | AI generates areas and hiddenInfo on first visit |
| `detailed` | Full description provided, no generation needed |

## Movement Types

The system has three distinct movement mechanisms:

| Type | Scope | How It Works |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **MOVE** | Within a location | Uses `areas.paths` for valid targets |
| **TRAVEL** | Between locations | Uses coordinate distance, no path graph |
| **TELEPORT** | Anywhere | Bypasses all constraints |
| **FAST TRAVEL** | Anywhere | Like teleport, with optional location/area targeting |

## generateLocationDetails

Only runs when `complexityType: 'complex'` AND `detailType: 'basic'`.

Reads: basicInfo, existing areas
Generates: areas (with paths), hiddenInfo

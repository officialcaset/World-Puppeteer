# Settings

Edit `tabs/settings.json`.

## Power Level Framework

Characters progress through four power levels based on skill proficiency:

| Power Level | Skill Range | Experience |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| I | 1-10 | Fails almost every roll - training arc |
| II | 10-30 | Fails most rolls - underdog experience |
| III | 30-40 | Succeeds most rolls - capable hero |
| IV | 40-60 | Succeeds almost always - master |

The balanced values below support this progression curve.

## Required Fields by Category

> Player HP scaling lives on the health resource (`resourceSettings.health.maxValue` and `gainPerLevel`), not in `otherSettings`. See the ai-instructions skill for the Resource schema.

### Character Progression (progressionSettings)

Required section. Character XP and level-up configuration lives here (legacy configs with XP fields in `otherSettings` migrate automatically).

| Field | Balanced Value | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| `startingCharacterLevelUpRequirement` | `500` | Base XP for first level |

| `abilityPointEveryLevels` | `1` | Grant ability points every N levels |
| `abilityPointsPerGrant` | `1` | Ability points per grant (1/1 = one per level) |
| `attributePointEveryLevels` | `5` | Grant attribute points every N levels |

| `locationDiscoveryXP` | `10` | XP per party member on first entering an area |
| `levelUpTraitPool` | `[]` | Trait names offered on level-up picks — **empty means no trait picks are ever granted**; entries must name existing traits (see the traits skill) |
| `milestoneTitles` | defaults | `{ levelGranted, title }[]` — titles granted when a level is hit exactly; levels unique positive integers, titles non-blank |

All numeric fields must be positive whole numbers except `extraRequiredXPPerCharacterLevel` (non-negative).

## World-Specific Fields

These must be configured per-world:

| Field | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| `attributeSettings.attributeNames` | Thematic attribute names for the world |
| `attributeSettings.lowAttributeTraits` | See lowAttributeTraits format below |
| `attributeSettings.attributeStatModifiers` | Only where narratively sensible (e.g., Constitution to Health) |
| `attributeSettings.attributeDamageModifiers` | Optional. Per-point % bonus to outgoing damage, keyed by attribute (e.g. `{ strength: 1 }` = +1% damage per point). Positive values only |
| `attributeSettings.attributeDamageReductionModifiers` | Optional. Per-point % reduction to incoming damage, keyed by attribute (e.g. `{ dexterity: 1 }` = -1% damage taken per point). Positive values only |
| `skillSettings.skillTypeDifficultyBonus` | Always include `"none": 0`, others creative |
| `itemSettings.currencyName` | Thematic currency name |
| `itemSettings.itemCategories` | Always include `"Armor"`, `"Consumable"`, plus world-specific |
| `itemSettings.itemSlots` | World-specific |
| `combatSettings.damageTypes` | Types that fit world theme |
| `characterCreationMusic` | Optional top-level field. `"fantasy"` or `"nonfantasy"` background music for the character-creation screen. Defaults to `"fantasy"` |
| `imageModelSources` | Optional top-level field. Pins which platform-provided image model renders NPC portraits (`portrait`), location/area images (`location`), and region maps (`region`) while editing the world; games created from it start with these as their default but can pick their own. Omit fields to use the platform's current defaults |

## lowAttributeTraits Format

Each entry follows this structure: **"You have a weak [domain]. [What skill types this affects]. [Effect on learning and usage]."**

- Sentence 1: State the weakness plainly ("You have a weak X")
- Sentence 2: Name the skill types powered by this attribute and state the consequence
- Sentence 3: Describe the practical effect on learning and reliability
- Reference skill/ability type names, not individual skill names
- Not every attribute needs an entry; omit attributes where a low value doesn't make narrative sense

## Schema

```typescript
interface Settings {
  attributeSettings: AttributeSettings
  skillSettings: SkillSettings
  locationSettings: LocationSettings
  itemSettings: ItemSettings
  combatSettings: CombatSettings
  otherSettings: OtherSettings
  progressionSettings: ProgressionSettings
  characterCreationMusic?: 'fantasy' | 'nonfantasy'
  imageModelSources?: { portrait?: string, location?: string, region?: string }
}
```

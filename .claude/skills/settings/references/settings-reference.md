}

interface AttributeStatModifier {
  variable: string                            // Resource name (e.g. 'health' or custom resource)
  amount: number                              // Bonus per attribute point
}
```

  regionMapBorderFeatheringEnabled?: boolean  // ✅ Whether region map images use the feathered border and rounded frame treatment (default: true)
}
```

## ItemSettings Schema

```typescript
interface ItemSettings {
  currencyName: string                        // ✅ Thematic currency name (world-specific)
  startingItems: StartingItem[]               // ✅ Items at character creation (balanced: [])
  itemCategories: string[]                    // ✅ Must include "Armor", "Consumable"
  itemSlots: ItemSlot[]                       // ✅ Must include 7 armor slots
}

interface StartingItem {
  name: string                                // Item key from items.json
  quantity: number                            // Number of items
}

interface ItemSlot {
  slot: string                                // Slot name (head, chest, etc.)
  category: string                            // Category from itemCategories
  quantity: number                            // Max items in slot
}
```

## CombatSettings Schema

```typescript
interface CombatSettings {
  baseCombatXP: number                        // ✅ Base XP for combat victory (balanced: 200)
  minCombatXP: number                         // ✅ Minimum XP from combat (balanced: 50)
  abilityCooldown: number                     // ✅ Cooldown given to AI-generated (learned) abilities, and the minimum turns between learning new ones. Does NOT affect predefined abilities (balanced: 0)
  abilityBonus: number                        // ✅ Default bonus given to AI-generated (learned) abilities. Does NOT scale predefined abilities, which use their own authored bonus (balanced: 10)
  npcDailyHealingAmount: number               // ✅ NPC healing per day (balanced: 999)
  damageTypes: string[]                       // ✅ Available damage types (world-specific). Use lowercase ASCII — matching against vulnerabilities/resistances/immunities is case-sensitive and unnormalized, so "Fire" ≠ "fire" and mismatches fail silently
}
```

## OtherSettings Schema

```typescript
interface OtherSettings {
  npcHealthPerLevel: number                   // ✅ NPC HP per level (balanced: 10)
  npcMinHealth: number                        // ✅ NPC base HP (balanced: 0)
}
```

Player HP scaling lives on the health resource in `resourceSettings` — `maxValue` is the level-1 maximum and `gainPerLevel` is the per-level growth. See the Resource schema in the ai-instructions reference.

## ProgressionSettings Schema

Required section controlling character XP, level-ups, and what each level-up grants. Validation surfaces errors for bad values; if an invalid value slips into a saved config anyway, the engine silently falls back to that field's default when the game loads.

```typescript
interface ProgressionSettings {
  startingCharacterLevelUpRequirement: number // ✅ XP required to reach level 2 (balanced: 500)
  extraRequiredXPPerCharacterLevel: number    // ✅ Additional XP added per subsequent level; 0 = flat curve (balanced: 100)
  maxCharacterLevel: number                   // ✅ Leveling stops at this level (balanced: 999)
  abilityPointEveryLevels: number             // ✅ Grant ability points every N levels (balanced: 1)
  abilityPointsPerGrant: number               // ✅ Ability points per grant (balanced: 1)
  attributePointEveryLevels: number           // ✅ Grant attribute points every N levels (balanced: 5)
  attributePointsPerGrant: number             // ✅ Attribute points per grant (balanced: 1)
  maxAttributeValue: number                   // ✅ Cap on any attribute raised by spending points (balanced: 999)
  traitPickEveryLevels: number                // ✅ Grant trait picks every N levels (balanced: 10)
  traitPicksPerGrant: number                  // ✅ Trait picks per grant (balanced: 1)
  locationDiscoveryXP: number                 // ✅ XP each party member gains on first entering an area (balanced: 10)
  levelUpTraitPool: string[]                  // ✅ Trait names offered on level-up trait picks (balanced: [])
  milestoneTitles: MilestoneTitle[]           // ✅ Titles granted at exact levels (balanced: Initiate@1, Adept@10, Veteran@20, Expert@30, Master@40, Legend@50)
}

interface MilestoneTitle {
  levelGranted: number                        // Level at which the title is granted (unique positive integer)
  title: string                               // Displayed title (non-blank)
}
```

### XP Curve

Reaching level 2 requires `startingCharacterLevelUpRequirement` XP; each later level adds `extraRequiredXPPerCharacterLevel` on top of the previous requirement (`0` gives a flat curve — the only field allowed to be 0). Leveling stops entirely at `maxCharacterLevel`.

### XP Sources

Characters gain XP from quest completion, major story events (party-wide), skill level-ups, and location discovery — every party member gains `locationDiscoveryXP` the first time the party enters each area (scaled up in NG+).

### Level-Up Grants

On each level-up, the new level L is checked against each grant interval:

- If L is a multiple of `abilityPointEveryLevels`, grant `abilityPointsPerGrant` ability points. The defaults (1/1) reproduce the classic one-ability-point-per-level behavior.
- If L is a multiple of `attributePointEveryLevels`, grant `attributePointsPerGrant` attribute points — capped so banked points never exceed what could still be spent under `maxAttributeValue`.
- If L is a multiple of `traitPickEveryLevels`, grant `traitPicksPerGrant` trait picks — capped by how many eligible pool traits remain.

### Spending Points and Picks

Players spend attribute points in the Stats tab (batch spend; the spend is rejected if any attribute would exceed `maxAttributeValue`), unlock traits from `levelUpTraitPool` in the Traits tab (the offered list is filtered by trait requirements, unlockedBy, and excludedBy; effects apply immediately, just like starting traits), and choose a displayed title.

**GOTCHA**: an empty `levelUpTraitPool` (the default) means no trait picks are ever granted, regardless of `traitPickEveryLevels`. See the traits skill for authoring the pool traits themselves.

### Milestone Titles

Titles are granted only when a level is hit exactly — a skipped milestone level is not back-granted later. A newly earned title is auto-selected and the player is prompted about it. Removing a title from the config retroactively hides it from players who already earned it. `levelGranted` values must be unique positive integers and titles must be non-blank.

### Constraints

Every numeric field must be a positive whole number, except `extraRequiredXPPerCharacterLevel` which may be 0 (non-negative). `levelUpTraitPool` entries must name existing traits.

## characterCreationMusic

```typescript
characterCreationMusic?: 'fantasy' | 'nonfantasy'  // ✅ Background music played during character creation. Defaults to 'fantasy'
```

Sets which background music plays on the character-creation screen. `'fantasy'` (the default) or `'nonfantasy'`.

## imageModelSources

```typescript
imageModelSources?: {
  portrait?: string   // ✅ Image model used for NPC portraits
  location?: string   // ✅ Image model used for location and area images
  region?: string     // ✅ Image model used for region map images
}
```

Optional top-level field that pins which image-generation model renders each image type for the world and games created from it. Values are image model names provided by the platform. Leave a field unset (or set to an unrecognized name) to fall back to the platform's current default model for that type.

## Skill Check Formula

```
successScore = totalBonus - totalDifficulty

totalBonus = skillBonus + attributeBonus + earlyGameBonus + randomBonus + modifierBonus

Where:
  skillBonus = skillBonusModifier * effectiveSkillLevel
  attributeBonus = (effectiveAttribute - 10) * attributeBonusModifier
  earlyGameBonus = 10 (if gameTick < 50, else 0)
```

## Combat Balance System

### Player HP Formula

```
Player HP at level L = resourceSettings.health.maxValue
                     + gainPerLevel × (L - 1)
                     + milestoneHealthBonus
```

Where `milestoneHealthBonus = floor(L / 5) × 5`. `maxValue` is level-1 HP; `gainPerLevel` accrues from level 2 onward.

Example at level 20 with balanced values (maxValue=80, gainPerLevel=10):
- Base: 80 + (10 × 19) = 270
- Milestone: floor(20/5) × 5 = 20
- Total: 290 HP

### Player Damage Formula

```
Player DPR = 16.4 + (2.5 × level) + milestoneDamageBonus
```

Where `milestoneDamageBonus = floor(level / 5) × 2`

NPC damage scales more simply: **+2.0 per level** with no milestone bonuses. So a high-level player out-scales an equal-level NPC slightly (2.5/level + milestones vs. a flat 2.0/level).

These are engine constants, not configurable. They determine how fast players deal damage at each level.

### NPC HP Formula

```
NPC HP = (npcHealthPerLevel × level + npcMinHealth) × tierHPModifier × healthMultiplier × difficultyHealthMultiplier
```

When an NPC has no authored `hpMax`, this is derived live whenever it's needed (not frozen at world load), so HP always reflects the game's current difficulty. An authored `hpMax` on an NPC with an authored `level` is used exactly as written; on a level-less NPC it only guarantees a minimum. See the npcs reference for details.

| Tier | HP Modifier |
|------|-------------|
| trivial | 0.15 |
| weak | 0.5 |
| average | 1.0 |
| strong | 1.25 |
| elite | 1.5 |
| boss | 1.7 |
| mythic | 1.85 |

### NPC Tier Damage Modifiers

Each tier also scales NPC damage output (engine constants, not configurable):

| Tier | Damage Modifier |
|------|-----------------|
| trivial | 0.65 |
| weak | 0.8 |
| average | 1.0 |
| strong | 1.12 |
| elite | 1.25 |
| boss | 1.4 |
| mythic | 1.55 |

### Milestone Bonuses

Players receive milestone bonuses every 5 character levels (engine constants):

| Milestone | HP Bonus | Damage Bonus |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Every 5 levels | +5 HP | +2 damage |

Example at level 25: 5 milestones = +25 HP, +10 damage on top of per-level scaling.

### Difficulty Multipliers

NPC stats scale by encounter difficulty (engine constants, not configurable):

| Difficulty | NPC Damage | NPC Health |
|------------|------------|------------|
| very easy | 0.7× | 0.5× |
| easy | 0.85× | 0.75× |
| medium | 1.0× | 1.0× |
| hard | 1.15× | 1.25× |
| very hard | 1.3× | 1.5× |

### Level-Differential Damage Reduction

When an attacker hits a target that is a **higher level than themselves**, outgoing damage is reduced. Each level of difference adds less than the last (5% for the first, diminishing by 10% per step), and the total plateaus at 27.5% once the gap reaches 10 levels.

| Levels target is above attacker | Damage reduction |
|---|---|
| 1 | 5.0% |
| 2 | 9.5% |
| 3 | 13.5% |
| 4 | 17.0% |
| 5 | 20.0% |
| 6 | 22.5% |
| 7 | 24.5% |
| 8 | 26.0% |
| 9 | 27.0% |
| 10+ | 27.5% (max) |

Hitting a target at the same or lower level applies no reduction.

### Impact

Every attack carries an **impact** value from **50 to 200** (100 = normal) that the AI assigns per-attack based on how the action is described. It multiplies damage by `impact / 100`, and applies to both player and NPC attacks.

| Impact | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| 50 | 0.5× |
| 100 | 1.0× |
| 150 | 1.5× |
| 200 | 2.0× |

### Evasion

A character that takes a **defend / evade action on a turn** reduces the incoming damage of attacks against them that turn. The reduction scales with how well the defend roll succeeded; a reduction of 1.0 or higher fully nullifies the hit (it lands but deals 0). This is an active, per-turn choice driven by the defend roll, not a passive stat.

### NPC Success Rolls

An NPC attack's success level is fixed RNG each turn (NPCs have no skills or attributes to roll):

| Outcome | Chance |
|---|---|
| critical success | 10% |
| great success | 20% |
| success | 40% |
| basic success | 30% |

The only way an NPC attack drops below "basic success" is **combat conflict**: when a player's defend action succeeds, it degrades the attacking NPC's outcome (a strong defense turns the NPC's attack into a failure).

### Encounter Health Budget

The engine targets **4 rounds** to kill (TTK) when sizing encounters:

```
Encounter HP Budget = 4 × effectivePartySize × playerExpectedDPR
```

Where `effectivePartySize = playerCount + (npcAllyCount × 0.7)`

NPC allies count at 70% effectiveness. This determines total enemy HP the engine distributes across NPCs in a generated encounter.

## Skill XP Requirements

```
XP to reach skill level N = startingXPToLevelUpSkill + (N - 1) * additionalXPRequiredPerSkillLevel
```

With balanced values (50/50):
- Level 1: 50 XP
- Level 10: 500 XP
- Level 30: 1,500 XP

## Character Level XP Requirements

Both fields live in `progressionSettings`:

```
XP to reach character level N = startingCharacterLevelUpRequirement + (N - 2) * extraRequiredXPPerCharacterLevel
```

With balanced values (500/100):
- Level 2: 500 XP
- Level 5: 800 XP
- Level 10: 1,300 XP

Leveling stops at `maxCharacterLevel`.

## Power Level Success Rates

| Power Level | Skill Range | vs Medium (30) | vs Hard (60) |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| I | 1-10 | Fails most | Fails almost all |
| II | 10-30 | Sometimes | Rarely |
| III | 30-40 | Usually | Sometimes |
| IV | 40-60 | Almost always | Usually |

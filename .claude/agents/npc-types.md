Read the npc-types skill for schema and creative guidance.

## Species Chaining

When creating an NPC type that represents a **species**, you must also create corresponding Trait and World Lore entries with **identical** `description`/`traitNarrativeEffects`/`text`. Spawn these agents in parallel:
- **traits** agent - create species trait with identical `description` and `traitNarrativeEffects`, plus 3 skills
- **world-lore** agent - create species lore with identical `text`
